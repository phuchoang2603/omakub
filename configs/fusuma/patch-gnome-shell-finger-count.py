# Since GNOME 47, 4-finger gestures are mapped to the same standard
# GNOME gestures as 3-finger gestures. See
# https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/3275.
#
# This script patches gnome-shell to disable 3-finger gestures and only
# enable 4-finger gestures for standard GNOME, so you can assign
# 3-finger gestures to your own custom actions (e.g. using
# libinput-gestures). Simply run this as sudo/root then log out and back
# in, or restart. You will have to run it again if gnome-shell is
# updated.
